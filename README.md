# Development

The javascript and scss files are managed by Gulp. 

Run *gulp* in the command line before committing to ensure that the files are minified and parsed.

## Installation of gulp:
 - Install node [http://nodejs.org/]
 - *npm install gulp*
 - *npm install*

When adding new dependencies to gulp make sure to use npm install <package> --save-dev so that the dependencies get saved in package.json.
